        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        
        <P>I'm Priyadarishini N, a Tamil Indian born and raised in the vibrant city of Mysore, Karnataka. As the eldest
            of
            two sisters, I've always been passionate about learning and exploring new opportunities. I'm fluent in both
            Tamil and Kannada, reflecting my deep connection to my heritage. After completing my schooling at Shastry
            Public
            School, Hunsur, and Seshadripuram PU College, Mysore, I pursued a Bachelor of Engineering degree. Currently,
            I'm
            excited to be furthering my education with a Master of Business Administration at Mar Ephraem College of
            Engineering and Technology in Kanyakumari.</P>

    <section class="CAREER">
        <h2>CAREER</h2>
        <P>I'm a dedicated professional with a strong background in client communication and education technology. After
            completing my engineering degree, I joined Byju's and gained valuable experience in the industry.
            Subsequently,
            I had the opportunity to work on a project at Vedantu under the guidance of Arjun Mohan, where I honed my
            skills
            as an academic counselor for two years. Currently, I'm contributing my expertise to Omnucious, where I
            continue
            to excel in building relationships with clients and managing diverse lead sets and campaigns.</P>
