        <h1><b>Campaigns</b></h1>
        <p>A Google Ads campaign is a set of one or more ad groups (ads, keywords, and bids) that share a budget, location targeting, and other settings. Campaigns are typically used to organize categories of products or services offered by an advertiser.</p>
        
        <p>Items that can be set at the campaign level include bids, budget, language, location, distribution for the Google Network, and more. Large advertisers typically create separate ad campaigns to run ads in different locations or using different budgets.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><b>Campaign types</b></h2>
        <p>Campaign types are centered around Google's advertising networks: the Google Search Network, the Google Display Network, and the YouTube Network.</p>
        
        <p>These networks make up all the places where your ads can appear, including Google sites, websites that show relevant Google ads, and other placements (such as mobile apps).</p>
        <br>
        <p>You choose a network setting by selecting a campaign type for your campaign. The API supports the following campaign types:</p>
        <ol>
